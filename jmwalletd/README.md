# jmwalletd

JAM-compatible HTTP and WebSocket daemon for JoinMarket NG.

## Overview

`jmwalletd` exposes wallet, transaction, and CoinJoin operations over a FastAPI API
compatible with the reference JoinMarket `jmwalletd`, so JAM can talk to JoinMarket NG.

## Documentation

For full documentation, see
[jmwalletd Documentation](https://joinmarket-ng.github.io/joinmarket-ng/README-jmwalletd/).

## What It Provides

- REST API under `/api/v1`
- WebSocket notifications on `/ws`, `/api/v1/ws`, and `/jmws`
- JWT auth (access and refresh tokens)
- Orderbook proxy endpoints under `/obwatch/*`
- Experimental wallet-native credential seller and explicit ledger maintenance
  under `/api/v1/wallet/{walletname}/market/*`, documented in the
  [credential market guide](../docs/credential-market.md#native-seller-operations)

## Run

Install in a virtualenv from repo root (jmwalletd uses the maker, taker, and
tumbler components at runtime):

```bash
python -m pip install -e ./jmcore -e ./jmwallet -e ./maker -e ./taker \
    -e ./tumbler -e ./jmwalletd
```

Start the daemon:

```bash
jmwalletd
```

Defaults:

- bind host: `127.0.0.1`
- port: `28183`
- TLS: enabled with an auto-generated self-signed cert in `~/.joinmarket-ng/ssl/`

Common options:

```bash
# run plain HTTP on loopback (for a local TLS-terminating reverse proxy)
jmwalletd --no-tls

# listen on all interfaces with TLS enabled
jmwalletd --host 0.0.0.0

# custom data dir
jmwalletd --data-dir /path/to/data
```

The wallet API accepts passwords and returns bearer tokens. Never expose it over
plain HTTP to an untrusted network. `--no-tls` should be used only on loopback,
or on an isolated container network behind an access-controlled, TLS-terminating
reverse proxy. Binding to `0.0.0.0` makes the API reachable on any interface
allowed by the firewall; clients must verify the daemon's TLS certificate.

## Configuration

`jmwalletd` uses the shared JoinMarket NG config (`~/.joinmarket-ng/config.toml`) and
the same environment override model as other components.

Important settings usually come from these sections:

- `[network_config]` for network selection (`network`, `bitcoin_network`)
- `[bitcoin]` for backend config (`descriptor_wallet` or `neutrino`)
- `[tor]` for SOCKS and control settings

Fee policy set at runtime through the API (`POST /configset`, as done by JAM's
fee settings modal) takes precedence over the config file for direct sends,
coinjoins, and tumbles. The reference `[POLICY] tx_fees` semantics apply:
values from 1 to 1000 are a block confirmation target, values above 1000 are a
fee rate in sat/kvB (for example `5000` means 5 sat/vB). These overrides are
in-memory only and are cleared when the wallet is locked. A `txfee` sent with a
single `taker/direct-send` or `taker/coinjoin` request uses the same semantics
and takes precedence over `[POLICY] tx_fees` for that request only; omit it or
send `0` to use the configured value, and note that a value beyond the money
supply is rejected rather than falling back to it. On the neutrino
backend, block-target estimation uses the external fee source configured via
`bitcoin.fee_estimate_url` (an onion-first fallback chain over Tor by default).
Multiple comma-separated URLs are tried in order. When external estimation is
disabled and no Tor proxy is available, set a sat/kvB value instead. External
estimates remain subject to `wallet.max_fee_rate_sat_vb` (default 1000 sat/vB).

Orderbook proxy target resolution is:

1. `OBWATCH_URL` env var
2. `orderbook_watcher.http_host` + `orderbook_watcher.http_port`
3. fallback `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Development

Run unit tests for this component:

```bash
pytest jmwalletd
```

For Docker-backed integration/e2e coverage, use the root test workflow:

```bash
./scripts/run_parallel_tests.sh
```

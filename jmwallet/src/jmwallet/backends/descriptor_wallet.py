"""
Bitcoin Core Descriptor Wallet backend.

Uses descriptor wallets with importdescriptors RPC for efficient UTXO tracking.
This is much faster than scantxoutset for ongoing wallet operations as Bitcoin Core
maintains the UTXO state automatically.

Key advantages over scantxoutset:
1. Persistent tracking: Once descriptors are imported, UTXOs are tracked automatically
2. Real-time updates: Balance updates as blocks arrive, no need for full UTXO set scan
3. Efficient queries: listunspent is O(wallet UTXOs) vs O(entire UTXO set) for scantxoutset
4. Mempool awareness: Can see unconfirmed transactions immediately

Trade-offs:
1. Requires wallet creation/management on Bitcoin Core side
2. Wallet files persist on disk (privacy consideration)
3. Initial import can take time for large descriptor ranges

# and is processing it, it is by definition working. Many wallet RPCs
# (``listdescriptors``, ``listreceivedbyaddress``, ``listunspent``,
# ``rescanblockchain``) block on internal locks or scale with wallet/chain size
# and routinely take longer than 30s under load (busy node, slow disk,
# Raspberry-Pi-class hosts). The previous 30s default produced spurious
# ``ReadTimeout`` errors that triggered fall-back paths with stale data
# (e.g. an empty descriptor-range map that caused subsequent
# ``importdescriptors`` to be rejected with ``new range must include
# current range``).

# cases without making a truly stuck process appear hung indefinitely;

        """
        Send a JSON-RPC batch to Bitcoin Core and return one result per call.

        A JSON-RPC batch lets the client send N method calls in a single HTTP
        POST body and receive N responses (possibly reordered) in a single
        response body. For methods that are individually cheap inside Bitcoin
        Core but dominated by HTTP round-trip cost (notably ``getaddressinfo``
        when scanning thousands of addresses), this is dramatically faster
        than a sequential loop, especially against a remote node.

        Per-call errors are surfaced as ``Exception`` objects in the result
        list (same index as the input call) rather than raising, so that one
        bad address does not poison results for the rest of the batch. The
        caller decides how to handle each failure. Transport-level errors
        (connection refused, timeout, malformed JSON, wallet-not-loaded) still
        raise, since they affect the entire batch.

        Args:
            calls: Sequence of ``(method, params)`` tuples to send as one batch.
            client: Optional httpx client (uses default client if not provided).
            use_wallet: If True, target the wallet-scoped URL (required for
                most wallet RPCs like ``getaddressinfo``).
            chunk_size: Maximum number of calls per HTTP POST. Larger values
                cut HTTP overhead further but can blow past httpx's response
                size limits and Bitcoin Core's request body limits on huge
                wallets. 500 has been benchmarked as a safe sweet spot.

        Returns:
            List of length ``len(calls)``; each entry is either the RPC
            ``result`` value or an ``Exception`` describing the per-call error.

        Raises:
            httpx.HTTPError: On transport-level errors.
            ValueError: On malformed batch responses or wallet-not-loaded
                errors that survive a single reload attempt.

        Trigger a server-side blockchain rescan and return once Bitcoin
        Core has actually started it.

        ``rescanblockchain`` is a blocking RPC, but the rescan itself runs
        inside Bitcoin Core (not the client) and is not bound to the HTTP
        connection: once Core accepts the call, the scan keeps running
        even if the client disconnects (this is what ``abortrescan``
        exists for). We exploit that by posting the RPC with a short
        HTTP timeout, swallowing the expected ``TimeoutException``, and
        then polling ``getwalletinfo.scanning`` to confirm the scan is
        actually in progress before returning.

        Previously this method used ``asyncio.create_task`` to run the
        RPC in the background. That task was tied to the current event
        loop and could be torn down before the RPC was ever sent if the
        caller exited shortly after, so the rescan kick could be a
        silent no-op.

        Args:
            start_height: Block height to start rescan from (default: 0 = genesis).
                The value is normalized via ``_effective_rescan_height``:
                floored up to the wallet creation height when one is set (the
                wallet cannot hold coins from before it was created, so
                scanning earlier blocks only wastes time) and clamped into
                ``[0, chain tip]`` so out-of-range requests do not make
                Bitcoin Core reject the rescan outright.

        Returns:
            True if the rescan already completed synchronously (fast
            regtest / already-synced wallets), False if a background scan
            is now running server-side and the caller should poll
            ``get_rescan_status`` / ``wait_for_rescan_complete``.

        Uses ``listsinceblock`` with an empty blockhash to fetch every
        wallet transaction (including change outputs) in a single RPC
        roundtrip. ``include_change=true`` is critical: without it Core
        silently drops change-branch addresses, which is the JoinMarket
        deposit-reuse bug that motivated the rewrite.

        Why not ``listtransactions skip=N``?
        -----------------------------------
        ``listtransactions`` is paginated with ``count``/``skip``, but
        Core walks the wallet's transaction list from the beginning on
        every call (O(N) per page → O(N^2) total). On real-world heavy
        JoinMarket wallets (220K+ tx-entries after a genesis rescan)
        page 200+ takes minutes server-side and routinely trips socket
        timeouts or causes bitcoind to drop the connection mid-stream.
        The walker then silently returned the partial result, the
        wallet thought it had enumerated history, and the next deposit
        address landed on a previously-funded address. See
        ``tmp/joinmarket_ng_wallet_rescan_3.txt`` for a real-world
        failure trace.

        ``listsinceblock`` enumerates in a single server-side pass: O(N)
        total, one HTTP roundtrip, one large JSON response. aiohttp /
        httpx stream multi-megabyte JSON without issue.

        Failure semantics
        -----------------
        Raises on any RPC error. The previous implementation logged a
        warning and returned whatever was collected so far; that was a
        privacy bug because the partial set was then treated as
        authoritative by the sync layer and persisted to BIP-329. The
        wallet's persisted ``used_addresses`` store remains the canonical
        do-not-reissue set; the sync layer is responsible for unioning
        this RPC result with persisted state (never replacing it).

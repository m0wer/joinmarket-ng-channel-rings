        """Auto-freeze UTXOs that landed on an already-spent (empty) used address.

        Defends against forced address-reuse (dust) attacks: an adversary pays a
        small amount to an address the wallet has already used and emptied,
        hoping the new coin gets co-spent and links the wallet's coins via the
        common-input-ownership heuristic. Per
        https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Forced_address_reuse, coins that land
        on an already-used *empty* address should never be spent (we freeze
        them); coins on an address that still holds funds should instead be
        fully spent together, so those are left untouched.

        A UTXO is auto-frozen only when ALL of the following hold:

        * Its outpoint is NOT in ``observed_outpoints`` -- it is a coin this
          process is seeing for the first time, never one we have already
          accounted for (this also makes the check robust to a transient sync
          that momentarily lost and then re-found the same coin).
        * Its address IS in ``observed_funded_addresses`` -- we positively
          observed this address holding a coin on an earlier sync. This is the
          crucial guard against #542: we never freeze a first-use coin that was
          merely *discovered late* (e.g. by a background rescan), because we
          would not have seen its address funded before.
        * Its address is NOT in ``prior_funded_addresses`` -- the address held
          no UTXO at the start of this sync, i.e. it was emptied before this
          arrival. If the address still holds funds the privacy-correct action
          is to fully spend them together, so those are left untouched. This is
          the key difference from legacy joinmarket-clientserver, which froze
          reuse on any used address.
        * It passes the value filter: ``max_sats_freeze_reuse == -1`` freezes
          all such reuse, a positive ``N`` freezes only ``value <= N`` sats, and
          ``0`` disables the behavior entirely.

        A UTXO that already has a metadata record (e.g. one the user
        deliberately unfroze, which keeps a labeled record) is left untouched,
        so an explicit unfreeze is never overridden. Fidelity bonds (timelocked,
        on the dedicated bond branch) are skipped.

        """Async deposit-address picker with on-chain verification.

        Wraps :meth:`get_next_after_last_used_address` with a backend
        round-trip per candidate: each proposed address is checked via
        :meth:`BlockchainBackend.address_has_history` (typically
        ``getreceivedbyaddress`` on Bitcoin Core). If the backend
        reports any prior funding the candidate is recorded as used
        (so subsequent picks skip it) and we advance to the next
        index.

        This is the privacy-critical belt-and-suspenders that catches
        the case where the in-memory ``addresses_with_history`` set is
        incomplete (RPC truncation during sync, node crash mid-walk,
        stale persisted state, or a wallet imported with no prior
        sync at all). The sync-layer bulk enumeration remains the
        fast common path; this method's per-address verification only
        runs at the moment we are about to hand an address to the
        user.

        A candidate is reserved before the backend round-trip. Verification
        outages fail closed, leaving that candidate reserved rather than
        exposing an address whose history is uncertain.

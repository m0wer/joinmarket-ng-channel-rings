        1. This wallet's own CoinJoin history is authoritative. Every confirmed

           change address as ``cj_change``, whether or not the coin is still

           seed-recovered wallet has no history file; a running wallet's plain
           deposits are never in it) are classified from the transaction that

        once per process (a failed fetch is not retried until ``force`` or a
        rescan), caps fetches per pass, and degrades silently to the existing
        display fallback when the backend cannot return a transaction.

        once and only the biggest UTXO counts as the bond). Choosing by value
        rather than by scan order is what makes the recorded value stable

          Core already tracks (e.g. from a past ``recover-bonds`` run or a

          re-running ``recover-bonds`` / ``import-bond``; and

        * refreshes the stored UTXO info (txid/vout/value/confirmations) of an
          already-registered bond when it no longer matches the chosen UTXO.
          A registered bond was previously matched via the direct-match path
          and never reconciled, so whichever UTXO happened to be recorded
          first (by scan order, or by an older build) stayed frozen in the

          mirrors what the dedicated ``jm-wallet sync-bonds`` command does, so
          a plain ``info`` sync no longer leaves the registry out of date.

        The registry file is only rewritten when something actually changed,
        so steady-state syncs do not churn it. Best-effort and non-fatal: a
        failure here normally only means the same reconciliation is retried on
        the next sync, never that a recognized UTXO disappears from the current

        Setup descriptor wallet backend for efficient UTXO tracking.

        This imports wallet descriptors into Bitcoin Core's descriptor wallet,
        enabling fast UTXO queries via listunspent instead of slow scantxoutset.

        By default, uses a bounded smart scan for faster startup, with a background
        full rescan to catch any older transactions.

        Should be called once on first use or when restoring a wallet.
        Subsequent operations will be much faster.

        Args:
            scan_range: Address index range to import. When ``None`` (default),
                resolves to ``self.scan_range`` (configured via
                ``[wallet].scan_range``, default 1000). Distinct from
                ``gap_limit`` which is the BIP44 trailing-empty threshold.
                The legacy ``max(DEFAULT_SCAN_RANGE, gap_limit * 10)`` formula
                was removed (issue #475).
            fidelity_bond_addresses: Optional list of (address, locktime, index) tuples
            include_all_fidelity_bonds: Import all 960 canonical fidelity bond
                addresses without marking unfunded addresses as known bonds. This
                is intended for mnemonic recovery, where the used locktime is not
                known before scanning.
            rescan: Whether to rescan blockchain
            check_existing: If True, checks if wallet is already set up and skips import
            rescan_existing: If True and existing descriptor coverage is complete,
                still start the requested full-history rescan. Used by retryable recovery.
            smart_scan: If True and rescan=True, scan from ~1 year ago for fast startup.
                       A full rescan runs in background to catch older transactions.

        Parse a descriptor to extract mixdepth, change, and index.

        When using xpub descriptors, Bitcoin Core returns a descriptor showing
        the path RELATIVE to the xpub we provided:

        We need to match this back to the original descriptor to determine mixdepth.

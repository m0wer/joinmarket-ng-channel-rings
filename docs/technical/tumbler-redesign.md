# Tumbler

The `tumbler` package builds and runs multi-phase CoinJoin plans that move
funds from a wallet's funded mixdepths to a list of destination addresses
while obscuring the link between origin and destination UTXOs.

It is consumed as a library and via a small CLI; nothing in `tumbler`
depends on `jmwalletd`. The HTTP daemon is one possible host, the CLI is
another, and a third-party caller can drive a `Plan` directly from Python.

## Problem

A wallet whose origin is publicly visible — a KYC'd buy, a reused
address, an observed UTXO graph — is hard to spend privately. A single
CoinJoin already breaks naive co-spending heuristics, but two analytical
signals survive a simple taker-only loop:

- **Subset-sum recovery.** A taker's input set must satisfy
  `sum(inputs) = cj_amount + change + cj_fees + tx_fee`. With non-equal
  CoinJoin outputs that constraint is well below the Lagarias–Odlyzko
  density bound, so an observer can recover the taker's true input set
  from the joined input pool with off-the-shelf subset-sum solving.
- **Role fingerprint.** A wallet that is *always* a taker has a
  different on-chain footprint than one that alternates roles: fees flow
  one way, UTXO ages drift one way, and the timing of activity is
  taker-driven. A long taker-only run is a worse mix than a shorter
  mixed-role one.

`tumbler` addresses both signals by chaining taker CoinJoins with
bounded maker sessions inside a single plan, and persists the plan as
human-readable YAML so a crashed daemon (or a curious operator) can
resume from a known state.

The user-facing privacy rationale, operational guidance, and fee overview live
in [`../README-tumbler.md`](../README-tumbler.md). This document focuses on the
data model and runtime behavior.

## Architecture

`tumbler` exposes three public symbols:

- `Plan` — a Pydantic model describing the full tumble: parameters,
  destinations, an ordered list of phases, and per-phase state.
- `PlanBuilder` — builds a `Plan` from per-mixdepth balances, a destination
  list, and `PlanParameters`.
- `TumbleRunner` — consumes a `Plan` and drives it to completion, persisting
  after every state transition.

```
caller (CLI, jmwalletd, library user)
   |
   v
TumbleRunner  --->  taker.Taker.do_coinjoin   (per CoinJoin)
   |          \-->  maker.MakerBot.start/stop  (per maker session)
   v
jmwallet.WalletService
```

No other package imports anything else from `tumbler`. There is no
network code, no new crypto, and no protocol-level change to JoinMarket
CoinJoin.

### Phases

A `Plan` is an ordered list of phases. The runner executes them one at a
time; a phase completes (or fails) before the next begins. Two phase
kinds are supported:

- `taker_coinjoin` — a single CoinJoin as taker. Carries `mixdepth`,
  one of `amount` (sats; `0` means sweep) or `amount_fraction` (of the
  current mixdepth balance), `destination` (an external address or the
  literal `"INTERNAL"`), `counterparty_count`, and an optional
  `rounding_sigfigs` (significant-figure count for amount obfuscation).
- `maker_session` — runs `MakerBot` for a bounded window or until a
  target number of CoinJoins have been served, whichever comes first.
  Carries `maker_session_seconds`, `maker_session_idle_timeout_seconds`,
  and an offer template (ordertype, minsize, fees).

Phases are separated by an `asyncio.sleep` sampled from an exponential
distribution with mean `time_lambda_seconds`. The first phase of any
plan is a `taker_coinjoin` sweep with `destination=INTERNAL`: every
funded mixdepth's UTXOs go through a CoinJoin before any external
destination is touched.

### Plan layout

A typical plan has two stages:

- **Stage 1 — origin cleavage.** For each non-empty mixdepth, in
  descending order, append a `taker_coinjoin` sweep into the next
  mixdepth with `destination=INTERNAL`. This step alone is what makes
  the resulting wallet hard to link to the original UTXO set.
- **Stage 2 — role-mixed body.** For each mixdepth on the way to the
  external destination, optionally insert a `maker_session`, then
  append `mintxcount - 1` fractional taker CoinJoins, then a final
  taker sweep. Only the last N chain mixdepths' sweeps target the user's
  destination addresses; every other sweep targets `INTERNAL`. The
  terminal chain mixdepth emits no fractional CoinJoins: an `INTERNAL`
  fraction from it would land in a mixdepth outside the chain that no
  later phase sweeps, stranding funds in the wallet (the reference
  tumbler applies the same cleanup in `get_tumble_schedule`). Its
  external sweep is therefore its only spend, guaranteeing the plan
  fully empties the wallet minus fees.

Maker sessions are inserted only when `include_maker_sessions=True`.
Without them the plan reduces to a pure taker chain similar in spirit to the
reference tumbler.

### Subset-sum mitigation

A maker session sits between two taker phases. The session consumes
UTXOs selected by *other* takers — subsets we did not control — and
creates a maker-side CoinJoin output plus whatever maker-side change is
implied by our inputs and the taker-chosen equal amount. We do not get to
choose a change amount that "matches the taker"; only the equal CoinJoin
amount is shared across participants. By the time the next taker phase fires, the
wallet's UTXO graph has new points whose linkage back to the pre-maker
set is mediated by taker-chosen subsets, which raises the cost of
subset-sum recovery from "off-the-shelf solver" to "simulate or
participate in the tumble."

This does not close the subset-sum vulnerability completely; closing
it requires protocol-level changes (standard denominations, or
taker-matches-maker-change). The mitigation composes cleanly with any
future protocol fix.

### Plan persistence (YAML)

A plan is stored at `<data_dir>/schedules/<walletname>.yaml`, one file
per wallet, overwritten in place on every state transition. There is no
database, no WAL, and no journal; the YAML file is the full source of
truth.

Phase `status` is one of `pending | running | completed | failed |
cancelled | skipped`. On startup the runner reloads the file: if
`current_phase` points to a `running` phase it resumes that phase,
otherwise it continues with the next `pending` one. `skipped` is
terminal like `completed`: a resume never re-runs a skipped phase.

YAML is chosen over JSON for legibility — operators open this file with
an editor during support — and over TOML for clean nesting of phase
records with heterogeneous schemas per `kind`.

### Failure handling and retries

Each taker phase has a retry budget given by `PlanParameters.max_phase_retries`
(default 3, range 0-20). When a taker phase fails the runner increments
`attempt_count`, persists, and rearms the same phase for retry.

Current retry behavior is intentionally narrow:

- The runner does not lower `counterparty_count` on retry. Maker selection,
  replacement, and any reduction to available offers are handled inside the
  taker against the live orderbook.
- If the phase originally targeted an external destination, the destination is
  rewritten to `"INTERNAL"`. The retry still happens at the same mixdepth and a
  later phase is responsible for actually paying the external address. The
  rewrite is skipped when no later pending taker phase spends from the mixdepth
  the `INTERNAL` deposit would land in (notably the plan's final external
  sweep): diverting there would strand the funds in the wallet and leave the
  destination unpaid.
- A configurable retry delay is applied before the next attempt. Confirmation-
  age style failures such as `No eligible UTXOs in mixdepth` and PoDLE age
  failures are surfaced through taker failure text so the operator can tell the
  difference between UTXO-age problems and maker-availability problems.

When `attempt_count` reaches `max_phase_retries` the phase remains
`failed` and the whole plan transitions to `failed`. A failed maker
session is not retried; the runner proceeds to the next phase.

One class of failure bypasses the retry budget entirely: a taker phase
that fails with `No eligible UTXOs in mixdepth` while the mixdepth's
spendable (unfrozen, non-bond) balance is zero is marked `skipped` and
the plan advances immediately. Retrying cannot help — there is nothing
to mix — and this situation arises legitimately when the operator
freezes funds after the plan was built, or when the stage-2 chain visits
a mixdepth the actual coin flow never reached. Unconfirmed funds still
count as spendable, so confirmation-age failures keep the ordinary retry
behavior. Plan-time balances already exclude frozen UTXOs and fidelity
bonds, so `skipped` phases are the runtime safety net, not the norm.

A crashed `jmwalletd` resumes from the persisted plan. Worst case a
single phase is attempted twice, which for a taker phase means a
duplicate CoinJoin (extra fee cost only) and for a maker phase means a
short double-maker window.

## Library example

```python
from pathlib import Path

from tumbler import PlanBuilder, TumbleRunner
from tumbler.builder import TumbleParameters

balances = {0: 200_000_000, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0}
destinations = [
    "bcrt1qdest0000000000000000000000000000000000aaa",
    "bcrt1qdest0000000000000000000000000000000000bbb",
    "bcrt1qdest0000000000000000000000000000000000ccc",
]

params = TumbleParameters(
    destinations=destinations,
    mixdepth_balances=balances,
    maker_count_min=5,
    maker_count_max=9,
    time_lambda_seconds=21600.0,
    include_maker_sessions=True,
    maker_session_seconds=43200.0,
    max_phase_retries=3,
    seed=42,
)

plan = PlanBuilder(wallet_name="alice", params=params).build()

runner = TumbleRunner(plan=plan, data_dir=Path("/tmp/jm-tumbler"), ...)
await runner.run()
```

## Privacy invariants

The plan builder is constrained to satisfy a fixed set of
privacy/safety properties for every seed. These are pinned by the tumbler test
suite over many seeds and balance scenarios:

- Every external destination receives at least one payout.
- Per-phase amount fractions are bounded in `[0.05, 1.0)` and the
  per-mixdepth fractional sum stays below `0.96`, guaranteeing a
  trailing sweep with non-dust value.
- Per-phase counterparty fee bound matches
  `max(cj_fee_abs, cj_fee_rel * amount) * counterparty_count` so the
  upfront estimate cannot under-promise.
- Worst-case total fee never exceeds the starting balance: the protocol
  cannot drain the wallet to fees.
- The estimator's reported balance equals the configured per-mixdepth
  balance map (no silent field drift).
- Phase indices are contiguous; counts match `taker + maker`.

## Amount rounding

By default a fraction of non-sweep taker CJs (`rounding_chance=0.25`)
have their resolved sat amount rounded to a random number of
significant figures, drawn from a weighted distribution
(`rounding_sigfig_weights=(55, 15, 25, 65, 40)` for 1-5 sigfigs).
This is a 1:1 port of the reference's `do_round` schedule entry and
prevents the wallet's sat-precise balance from leaking through to the
CoinJoin amount. Sweeps and explicit-amount phases never round.
The rounding is sampled at plan-build time and stored on
`TakerCoinjoinPhase.rounding_sigfigs`, so the persisted plan is
deterministic given the seed.

## Legacy schedule projection (JAM)

While a plan is running, `GET /api/v1/session` exposes it to
authenticated clients through the legacy `schedule` field so JAM can
render its scheduler progress view. `jmwalletd.legacy_schedule`
projects the live plan into the reference's 7-element entries
(`[mixdepth, amount, counterparties, destination, wait_minutes,
rounding, flag]`), where the flag is `0` before broadcast, the txid
while waiting for confirmations, and `1` once the plan advances past
the phase. Maker sessions have no legacy equivalent; their expected
duration and inter-phase wait are folded into the preceding taker
entry's wait time so JAM's ETA stays meaningful. The schedule is
computed from the in-memory runner on every request (never cached), and
is `null` whenever no tumble is running, matching the reference, which
also returns no schedule for single-shot taker CoinJoins.

## Maker diversity across phases

Within a single tumble, the runner remembers public identity keys for
the makers in the previous successful broadcast. Each maker contributes
a nickname key. A maker with a positive verified fidelity bond also
contributes its bond outpoint, which recognizes the same bond when its
nickname changes.

The next phase passes those keys to `Taker.do_coinjoin` as
`penalized_maker_keys`. The ordinary maker selector remains the baseline.
A complete candidate set with `k` avoidable identity overlaps is accepted
with probability `0.8^k`; rejected sets are redrawn. All makers retain a
non-zero probability, and overlap forced by a thin orderbook is not
penalized. A bounded draw count falls back to the final valid baseline set,
so this privacy policy cannot make a CoinJoin fail.

The history is one successful phase deep, is held only in RAM, and is not
restored after a process restart. Failed and merely contacted makers do not
enter it. Fidelity-bond values themselves are never modified. The runner
falls back to the legacy `do_coinjoin` signature on `TypeError` so it stays
compatible with reference takers and existing test fakes that have not yet
adopted the keyword argument.

## Maker policy in tumbler-driven sessions

Maker phases inside a tumbler plan run with a forced policy: absolute
fee `cjfee_a = 0` and `ordertype = sw0absoffer` (or `tr0absoffer` for a
Taproot wallet). This means the wallet is offering free CoinJoin liquidity
for the duration of the maker
session - which is exactly the role-mixing signal we want, since a
profit-motivated maker has a different on-chain footprint than a
mixing-motivated one. The unused `cjfee_r` field is pinned to `0.001`.
Fidelity bonds and new channel-ring participation are disabled: reusing either
a bond or a Lightning node across transient maker phases would correlate them.
Configured ring nodes and journal locations remain available for recovery of
prior active rounds. A malformed ring journal still blocks startup rather than
letting the tumbler spend its unresolved inputs.

The mutator lives in `tumbler.maker_policy` and is wired into both maker
factories. Tests in `tumbler/tests/test_maker_policy.py` pin the behavior.

## Fee estimator

`tumbler.estimator.estimate_plan_costs` computes an upper bound on
total cost before the plan runs. The estimate covers:

- **Counterparty fees** per taker phase, taken as `max(abs, rel*amount)
  * counterparty_count`, summed across all taker phases (sweeps included).
- **Miner fees** per taker phase, computed from the same coarse fee
  model the taker uses for its own operator prompts: ~68 vB per P2WPKH
  input, ~31 vB per P2WPKH output, plus ~11 vB fixed overhead, at the
  resolved sat/vB.
- **Fee-rate source labelling**: `configured` if the user passed
  `--fee-rate`, `estimated` if the runner queried `estimatesmartfee`,
  `fallback` if neither was available (default 10 sat/vB).

The estimate is rendered by `jm-tumbler plan` so users see the
worst-case spend and can tune knobs before running. The same model is
used to assert the no-fund-loss invariant in tests.

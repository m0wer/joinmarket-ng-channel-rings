## Components

The implementation separates concerns into distinct packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `jmcore` | Core library: crypto, protocol definitions, models |
| `jmwallet` | Wallet: BIP32/39/84, UTXO management, signing |
| `directory_server` | Directory node: message routing, peer registry |
| `maker` | Maker bot: offer management, CoinJoin participation |
| `taker` | Taker bot: CoinJoin orchestration, maker selection |
| `tumbler` | Scheduler: multi-step CoinJoins and maker sessions |
| `jmwalletd` | Wallet daemon: JAM-compatible HTTP and WebSocket API |
| `orderbook_watcher` | Monitoring: orderbook visualization |
| `neutrino_server` (external) | Lightweight SPV server (BIP157/158) - [github.com/m0wer/neutrino-api](https://github.com/m0wer/neutrino-api) |

## Data Directory

JoinMarket NG uses a dedicated data directory for persistent files shared across sessions.

**Location:**

- Default: `~/.joinmarket-ng`
- Override: `--data-dir` CLI flag or `$JOINMARKET_DATA_DIR` environment variable
- Docker: `/home/jm/.joinmarket-ng` (mounted as volume)

**Structure:**

```
~/.joinmarket-ng/
├── config.toml            # Configuration file
├── cmtdata/
│   ├── commitmentlist     # PoDLE commitment blacklist (makers)
│   └── commitments.json   # PoDLE used commitments (takers)
├── state/
│   ├── maker.nick         # Current maker nick
│   ├── taker.nick         # Current taker nick
│   ├── directory.nick     # Current directory server nick
│   └── orderbook.nick     # Current orderbook watcher nick
├── history.csv            # Transaction history log (CoinJoins + plain sends)
├── wallets/
│   ├── default.mnemonic        # Encrypted BIP39 mnemonic (CLI wallets)
│   └── default.mnemonic.meta   # Sidecar: creation_height + cached wallet fingerprint
├── wallet_metadata_<fp>.jsonl  # Per-wallet UTXO/address metadata (fp = master-key fingerprint)
└── fidelity_bonds_<fp>.json    # Per-wallet fidelity bond registry (fp = master-key fingerprint)
```

The `<fp>` placeholder is the 8-char hex fingerprint of the wallet's master key,
matching `jm-wallet info`. Files with this suffix are scoped to a single wallet
so different wallets sharing the same data directory do not see each other's
bonds or address metadata. A pre-partition `fidelity_bonds.json` (without
fingerprint) is migrated into the per-wallet file automatically the first time
its owning wallet is opened; entries the migration cannot attribute remain in
the shared file until claimed.

**Shared Files:**

| File | Used By | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `cmtdata/commitmentlist` | Makers | Network-wide blacklisted PoDLE commitments |
| `cmtdata/commitments.json` | Takers | Locally used commitments (prevents reuse) |
| `history.csv` | Both | Transaction history with confirmation tracking (CoinJoins and plain sends; legacy name: `coinjoin_history.csv`, renamed in place on first read) |
| `state/*.nick` | All | Component nick files for self-CoinJoin protection |

**Nick State Files:**

Written at startup, deleted on shutdown. Used for:

- External monitoring of running bots
- Startup notifications with nick identification
- **Self-CoinJoin Protection**: Taker reads `state/maker.nick` to exclude own maker; maker reads `state/taker.nick` to reject own taker

**CoinJoin History:**

Records all CoinJoin transactions with:

- Pending transaction tracking (initially `success=False`, updated on confirmation)
- Automatic txid discovery for makers who didn't receive the final transaction
- Address blacklisting for privacy (addresses recorded before being shared with peers)
- CSV format for analysis: `jm-wallet history --stats`

## Wallet File Formats

Three wallet persistence formats with overlapping terminology are not
interoperable:

- **joinmarket-clientserver JMDAT:** the reference implementation stores wallet
  state in its JMDAT format, conventionally named `wallet.jmdat`. JoinMarket NG
  does not read that format.
- **JoinMarket NG native CLI:** `jm-wallet`, `jm-maker`, and `jm-taker` use an
  encrypted BIP39 mnemonic file conventionally named `*.mnemonic`, with state in
  fingerprint-keyed sidecars. Select a non-default file with `--mnemonic-file`.
- **JoinMarket NG daemon/JAM:** `jmwalletd` writes a versioned encrypted container
  identified by the `JMNG` magic bytes. JAM v1 currently uses `.jmdat` filenames
  for API compatibility, but these files do not contain JMDAT and cannot be
  opened by joinmarket-clientserver; `jmwalletd` likewise cannot open a reference
  JMDAT wallet.

The intended future native suffix for the daemon container is `.jmng`. Version 1
continues to use `.jmdat` naming for JAM compatibility until wallet-name aliases
or capability support exists. No suffix alias or migration is currently
implemented.

## Wallet Persistence Design ([issue #524](https://github.com/joinmarket-ng/joinmarket-ng/issues/524))

Per-wallet state is split across several files keyed by the 8-char BIP32
`m/0` fingerprint rather than packed into one encrypted container (the
reference implementation's JMDAT model). The split was chosen deliberately:

- **Concurrency:** a running maker, a CLI command, and `jmwalletd` can
  touch wallet state at the same time. Independent files with atomic
  per-file writes (and a flock sidecar for the metadata store) avoid the
  single-file lock contention and stale PID-lock recovery that the
  reference JMDAT format suffers from.
- **Passwordless reads:** the mnemonic password guards spending, not
  inspection. History, bond listing, and labels live outside the
  encrypted mnemonic so they can be read without decryption. The
  `.mnemonic.meta` sidecar caches the wallet fingerprint so even
  resolving "which wallet is active" needs no password.
- **Interoperability:** UTXO/label/freeze state is stored as BIP-329
  JSON Lines, importable by other wallets; UTXO state itself lives in the
  external Bitcoin Core descriptor wallet rather than being duplicated.
  Handed-out and user-reserved deposit addresses are recorded in the same
  file (`jm:reserved` address labels) so they are never reissued across
  restarts.

The metadata file also carries owner-qualified, temporary CoinJoin input
leases. All concurrently running JoinMarket NG processes that share a wallet
metadata file must be upgraded together when the lease format or semantics
change. An older binary cannot enforce ownership fields it does not understand,
so mixed-version concurrent access is unsupported; advisory locking alone
cannot make an old process apply new lease rules.

Active channel-ring records retain the owner token for their wallet input leases.
On startup and periodic reconciliation, makers and takers renew matching live
leases before attempting to restore missing or expired leases from that durable
record. After upgrade, existing owned records keep this restoration behavior;
no wallet or ring format migration is required. A live lease belonging to another
owner, a partially present set of leases, a corrupt record, or an older record
without an owner token blocks ring recovery. Missing metadata alone never
authorizes restoration, and recovery does not overwrite another owner's lease.

Ring deployments must budget the maker's `session_timeout_sec` and
`pre_sign_timeout_sec` for negotiation and cancellation. If the ordinary session
expires first, its authenticated message route is removed while durable ring
state can still require the inputs to remain locked.

A durably retired cancellation also releases the session's in-flight PoDLE
outpoint reservation, allowing a later round to authenticate with a fresh proof.
Used-proof checks still apply.

Active-wallet identity is resolved uniformly for all per-wallet read
commands (see [Wallet](wallet.md)): explicit fingerprint, then `--mnemonic-file`,
then the configured/default wallet's cached `.meta` fingerprint, then
single-wallet auto-detection. This single resolution path is what keeps
each wallet's history and bonds isolated
([#473](https://github.com/joinmarket-ng/joinmarket-ng/issues/473),
[#492](https://github.com/joinmarket-ng/joinmarket-ng/issues/492),
[#523](https://github.com/joinmarket-ng/joinmarket-ng/issues/523)).

Files that are intentionally **not** per-wallet: `cmtdata/*` (PoDLE
commitments are UTXO-derived and the blacklist is network-shared),
`state/*.nick` (per component, for self-CoinJoin protection),
`ignored_makers.txt`, and `config.toml`.

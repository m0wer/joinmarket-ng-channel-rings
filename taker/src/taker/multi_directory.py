    tracking - a nick is only considered "gone" when ALL directories report
    it as disconnected.

    Direct Peer Connections:
    When enabled (prefer_direct_connections=True), the client will establish
    direct Tor connections to makers when possible, bypassing directory servers
    for private messages. This improves privacy by preventing directories from
    observing who is communicating with whom.

    Connection flow:
    1. First message to a maker goes via directory relay
    2. Opportunistically starts direct connection in background
    3. Subsequent messages prefer direct connection if available
    4. Falls back to directory relay if direct connection fails

    This prevents premature maker removal when:
    - A maker temporarily disconnects from one directory but remains on others
    - Directory connections are flaky or experiencing network issues
    - There's a race condition between directory updates
